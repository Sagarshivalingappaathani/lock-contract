# Decentralized Locking Mechanism with USDT Integration

## Project Overview

This project implements a decentralized locking mechanism using Solidity smart contracts.  It integrates with a USDT (Tether) token, allowing users to lock and potentially unlock assets secured by the contract.  The system is designed for security and transparency on a blockchain network.

## Features

* **Secure Locking Mechanism:**  Provides a secure and verifiable method for locking assets.
* **USDT Integration:** Utilizes USDT for locking and potentially unlocking assets.
* **Transparent Transactions:** All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and auditability.
* **Smart Contract Implementation:** Uses Solidity for robust and secure smart contract functionality.
